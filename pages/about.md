# About {{ site.title }}.

This site is generated using `collectionbuilder-gh`, a project to generate a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents

 `collectionbuilder-gh` is intended as a simple template for hands-on teaching about digital libraries.
It can be used in a workshop setting to take participants through digitization and metadata creation, to having a live collection site hosted on GitHub.

Similar learning experiences use DAMS/[CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) platforms that are often overkill for one-off projects. Although CMS feature familiar GUI administration interfaces, they are not simple to learn and customize.

`collectionbuilder-gh` aims to be well documented and easy to configure by following the example.
A project in "minimal computing," it provides a depth of learning opportunities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world.

## Learn about:

- Git and GitHub basics for collaboration and project management
- [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for plaintext writing and content creation
- HTML, CSS, and JS literacy
- commandline literacy
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) basics
- working in the Open, open source and open data
- digital libraries concepts such as "collections as data", minimal computing, data-driven design
